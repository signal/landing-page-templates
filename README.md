# Signal landing page templates

This project contains the source files for some of the landing page templates hosted within [Signal](http://www.signalhq.com/) application. Landing page templates are used within Signal to provide a base design and formatting layer for landing pages created and hosted within Signal.

Directory structure, required files and assets
------------

Landing page templates must adhere to the following, simple, directory structure:

  my_theme/
    template.html     (Your required template file)
    resources/        (A directory containing any images, static html pages,
                        CSS files, or other resources used by your template)

A file named template.html is required to exist in your landing page template. The content in the template.html file will be displayed in all pages that use the landing page template.

Contributing

Please feel free to grab any of these templates and use them as a way to jumpstart design of your own template, or just to make tweaks to one of the existing templates. If you'd like to add a template for other folks to use, feel free to fork this repo and send us a pull request with your template.

Alternatively, contact us via Twitter (@signal) with a link to a template your proud of and we'll retweet it out.
