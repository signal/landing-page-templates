# Signal landing page templates

This project contains the source files for some of the landing page templates hosted within [Signal](http://www.signalhq.com/) application. Landing page templates are used within Signal to provide a base design and formatting layer for landing pages created and hosted within Signal.

## Directory structure, required files and assets

Landing page templates must adhere to the following, simple, directory structure:

    my_theme/
      template.html     (Your required template file)
      resources/        (A directory containing any images, static html pages,
                        CSS files, or other resources used by your template)

A file named template.html is required to exist in your landing page template. The content in the template.html file will be displayed in all pages that use the landing page template.

## Contributing

Please feel free to grab any of these templates and use them as a way to jumpstart design of your own template, or just to make tweaks to one of the existing templates. If you'd like to add a template for other folks to use, feel free to fork this repo and send us a pull request with your template.
